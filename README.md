Mobile Computing Project CS855

1) Description of project 

An android application prototype to integrate the  Food Data Central API \cite{API} developed as part of CS 855 Mobile Computing course projec requirement. 
The 'Daily Diet Plan' android application allows the user to plan their daily meals based on the personal calorie requirements. 
Being a beginner in Android development and Kotlin programming language, this project is proposed as it allows to learn and explore the process of API integration, implementation and use of different user interface elements in an android app, to facilitate the daily diet plan application requirements.\\


*2)Features list 
 The Daily diet planner has two parts:
   a)Calorie estimation with user information
   b)Today's Diet 
The application begins with user information gathering.
Provide the daily diet plan application with your information including age in years, sex, height in centimeter , weight in kilogram, and your activity rate in a scale from 1 to 5 as deccribed below. 
The activity rate selection is from five categories:  
Not active - If user does little to no exercise and mostly sedentary
Lightly active - If use doeslight exercise likr 1 to 3 days per week
Active - If user does moderate exercise like 3 to 5 days per week
Very Active - If user performs heavy exercise daily or 6 to 7 days per week
Heavily active -If user performs very heavy exercise like twice per day or extra heavy workouts

With this user information the application evaluates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies user to a specific category among underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. 
The recommended daily calorie intake is estimated using the BMI and users activity rate.
The applications 'Home' tab displays this data as in figure 1.
